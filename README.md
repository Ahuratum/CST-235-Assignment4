# CST-235-Assignment4
For the assignment for week four, the goal was to learn about enterprise Java beans and an introduction to use cases. The first step was creating the interface from which the EJB implements. The assignment, then, went over designing and configuring an EJB in which a new file was created, the beans.xml file where all configurations of EJB are handled. At this point, modifications were needed in the controller where the EJBâ€™s were instantiated and controlled. After adding the required code to the controller, the assignment required the controller to utilize CDI in which the OrdersBusinessInterface was injected. Then, in the returned response page, the data was to call this service instead of the Orders managed bean. This allowed for different tables to be called, dependent on the specified EJB configuration. 
The last part of this assignment was to create timed events within the application in which certain information is logged in intervals. This was done by creating a new EJB timer class. This class handles any events that are to be scheduled when the user initiates it or at different times throughout the life of the application. In my class, I have the date and time being sent to the console log.
